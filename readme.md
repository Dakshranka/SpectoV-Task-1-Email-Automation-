# Google Sheets API Trigger Script

This Google Apps Script listens for edits made in a Google Sheet and triggers an HTTP request to a specified API endpoint with data from the edited row.

## Features

- Triggers on edits in a specific sheet (Sheet1).
- Sends a POST request to a custom Flask API with data from the edited row.
- Only processes rows below the header (ignores header row edits).
- Logs API responses and errors for debugging.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following:
1. **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. **Google Sheets** account with an existing sheet ready to be used.
3. **ngrok** installed on your machine to expose the Flask server.
4. **Gmail** account to send emails through Python.
5. **Flask** installed in your Python environment.

## Requirements

- A Google Sheets document with at least two columns:
  - Column 1: Name
  - Column 2: Email Address
- A Flask API (or similar HTTP server) capable of accepting POST requests with JSON payloads at a specified URL.
- **Ngrok** (if you're running the Flask API locally for testing purposes).

## Setup

### 1. **Create a New Google Sheets Script:**
   - Open your Google Sheets document.
   - Go to Extensions â†’ Apps Script.
   - Delete any default code in the editor and paste the provided script.

### 2. **Deploy the Script:**
   - Save the script in the Apps Script editor.
   - Go to Triggers (clock icon) in the Apps Script editor and set up a trigger to run the function myFunction on the event On edit.

### 3. **Install Ngrok (For Local Development):**
   If you're running your Flask API locally and want to expose it to the internet for testing, you can use Ngrok to create a tunnel. Follow these steps:
   
   - [Download Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and install it on your machine.
   - After installation, start your Flask API on your local machine (e.g., python app.py).
   - In another terminal window, run Ngrok to tunnel your local Flask server:
     
bash
     ngrok http 5000

     This will give you a public URL, such as https://1234abcd.ngrok.io, that you can use for testing.

### 4. **Edit the API URL:**
   - Replace the example URL (https://14f6-122-187-117-179.ngrok-free.app/trigger-email) in the script with the Ngrok URL (or your production URL if not using Ngrok).

### 5. **API Setup:**
   - Ensure that your Flask API is capable of handling POST requests at the /trigger-email endpoint.
   - The API should expect a JSON payload with the following structure:
     
json
     {
       "Name": "John Doe",
       "Email Address": "john.doe@example.com"
     }


## Script Details

### Function: myFunction(e)

- **Trigger:** This function is triggered by an onEdit event in the Google Sheets document.
- **Validation:**
  - The function ensures that the edit occurs in Sheet1 and that it is not a header row.
- **API Call:** 
  - Sends a POST request to the configured API endpoint with Name and Email Address data from the edited row.
- **Logging:** 
  - Logs success or error responses to the console for debugging.

### Example Payload:
When a row is edited in the sheet, the script sends a POST request with the following JSON payload:
json
{
  "Name": "John Doe",
  "Email Address": "john.doe@example.com"
}
